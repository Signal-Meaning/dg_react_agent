# Test documentation

This directory holds documentation for the project’s test suite (unit, integration, E2E, coverage, and CI strategy). It was moved here from `docs/` so test-related docs live next to the code they describe.

## Contents

- **[TESTING.md](./TESTING.md)** – Overview of testing approach and test types
- **[TESTING-QUICK-START.md](./TESTING-QUICK-START.md)** – Quick start guide for testing voice features
- **[TEST-UTILITIES.md](./TEST-UTILITIES.md)** – Test helpers, mocks, and infrastructure
- **[TEST-COVERAGE-ANALYSIS.md](./TEST-COVERAGE-ANALYSIS.md)** – Coverage analysis and gaps
- **[TEST-COVERAGE-PROXY-MODE.md](./TEST-COVERAGE-PROXY-MODE.md)** – Proxy mode test coverage
- **[PLAYWRIGHT_TESTING_PLAN.md](./PLAYWRIGHT_TESTING_PLAN.md)** – Playwright E2E testing plan
- **[E2E_CI_TEST_STRATEGY.md](./E2E_CI_TEST_STRATEGY.md)** – E2E and CI test strategy

For issue-specific test notes (e.g. why tests pass for a given issue), see `docs/issues/`.
