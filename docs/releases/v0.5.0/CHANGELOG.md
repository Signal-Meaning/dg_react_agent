# Changelog: v0.5.0

**Component**: `DeepgramVoiceInteraction`  
**Package**: `@signal-meaning/deepgram-voice-interaction-react`  
**Release Date**: October 2024

## 🔴 Breaking Changes

### Removed Callback: `onAgentSilent`

**Removed in**: v0.5.0+ (Issue #198)

**Reason**: This callback fired on `AgentAudioDone` (TTS generation complete), NOT when playback completed. This was misleading - audio may still be playing for several seconds after TTS generation finishes.

**Migration**: Use `onPlaybackStateChange(false)` to detect when agent playback actually completes.

**Before**:
```tsx
<DeepgramVoiceInteraction
  onAgentSilent={() => {
    console.log('Agent finished speaking');
  }}
/>
```

**After**:
```tsx
<DeepgramVoiceInteraction
  onPlaybackStateChange={(isPlaying) => {
    if (!isPlaying) {
      console.log('Agent finished speaking');
    }
  }}
/>
```

**Note**: `AgentStoppedSpeaking` is not a real Deepgram event (Issue #198). Agent state transitions to `idle` via `onPlaybackStateChange(false)` when playback completes.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Issue #190: Missing Agent State Handlers ✅ **RESOLVED**

**Status**: Resolved after v0.5.0 release

**Problem**: Agent conversations failed due to missing state transition handlers, causing idle timeout to fire prematurely and close WebSocket connections before agent responses were received.

**Solution**: Implemented all agent state handlers:
- `AgentThinking` → `thinking` state (disables idle timeout)
- `AgentStartedSpeaking` → `speaking` state (disables idle timeout)
- `AgentStoppedSpeaking` → Not a real Deepgram event (Issue #198). Agent state transitions to idle via `onPlaybackStateChange(false)` when playback completes.
- Playback event fallback → ensures `speaking` state even if `AgentStartedSpeaking` message is delayed

**Impact**: Agent state now transitions properly (`idle → speaking → idle` for text input, `idle → listening → [thinking] → speaking → idle` for voice input), and idle timeout is correctly disabled during agent responses.

**Test Coverage**: Comprehensive E2E and unit tests added to prevent regression.
