**Source:** [.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/release-checklist.md](../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/release-checklist.md)  
**Issue:** [Issue #439](https://github.com/Signal-Meaning/dg_react_agent/issues/439) — OpenAI proxy: start() with no options must not request transcription

Use this checklist when cutting a release that includes the Issue #439 fix. **This run: v0.8.4.**

## 🚀 Release v0.8.4 — Complete Release Process

### Overview

This release includes **Issue #439**: when the host uses an OpenAI proxy (`proxyEndpoint` containing `/openai`) and calls `ref.current.start()` with no arguments, the component no longer requests or creates a transcription manager; the session is agent-only. This checklist follows the repo release template.

The repository publishes two packages. CI (`.github/workflows/test-and-publish.yml`) publishes both when the workflow runs: **@signal-meaning/voice-agent-react** (root) and **@signal-meaning/voice-agent-backend** (`packages/voice-agent-backend`). **The backend has already been bumped** (e.g. Issue #441 → 0.1.2). For this release (#439), bump only the **root** component version.
