### Resolution Plan

#### Phase 1: Critical Issues (Issue #373 Related) 🔴
**Priority**: **HIGHEST** - These are related to the main feature of this release

1. [x] Fix `issue-373-idle-timeout-during-function-calls.spec.js` failures
   - [x] **FIXED**: Idle timeout now stops immediately when agent enters thinking state
     - Added immediate `stopTimeout()` call in `AGENT_STATE_CHANGED` handler when state becomes 'thinking'
     - Prevents timeout from firing during agent thinking phase before function calls
   - [x] **FIXED**: Proactive thinking state transition when user message is sent
     - `injectUserMessage()` now immediately transitions to thinking state before sending message
     - Prevents idle timeout from firing during gap between message send and agent response
     - Handles case where Deepgram doesn't send `AgentThinking` message
   - [x] **FIXED**: Function call completion tracking in test
     - Added missing `window.__FUNCTION_CALL_RESPONSE_SENT__ = true` flag in test handler
     - Allows test to properly detect when function call completes
   - [x] **FIXED**: Test reliability - replaced console log parsing with DOM-based checks
     - Test now monitors `[data-testid="connection-status"]` DOM element instead of console logs
     - More reliable detection of connection state changes
     - Eliminates false positives from log messages
   - [x] **Status**: ✅ **ALL TESTS PASSING** - All 4 Issue #373 tests now pass
     - ✅ "should NOT timeout during long-running function call execution" - PASSED (14.6s)
     - ✅ "should NOT timeout during agent thinking phase before function call" - PASSED (1.8s) **FIXED**
     - ✅ "should handle multiple concurrent function calls" - PASSED (1.6s)
     - ✅ "should re-enable idle timeout after function calls complete" - PASSED (16.7s)

#### Phase 2: Core Idle Timeout Behavior 🔴
**Priority**: **HIGH** - Core functionality

2. [x] Fix idle timeout behavior test failures (7 tests in `idle-timeout-behavior.spec.js`)
   - [x] **FIXED**: Updated `setupTestPage` to use `buildUrlWithParams` for automatic proxy mode support
   - [x] **FIXED**: Improved `establishConnectionViaText` with more reliable connection pattern
   - [x] **FIXED**: Increased `sendTextMessage` timeout for better reliability
   - [x] **Status**: ✅ **ALL 9 TESTS PASSING**

3. [x] Fix text session flow failures (4 tests)
   - [x] **FIXED**: Same fixes as idle-timeout-behavior (shared helpers)
   - [x] **Status**: ✅ **ALL 4 TESTS PASSING**

#### Phase 3: Agent State and VAD 🟡
**Priority**: **MEDIUM**

4. [ ] Fix VAD and agent state transition failures (4 tests)
   - [ ] Review agent state management
   - [ ] Check AgentThinking state handling
   - [ ] Investigate flaky test patterns

#### Phase 4: Configuration and Edge Cases 🟡
**Priority**: **MEDIUM-LOW**

5. [ ] Fix Deepgram instructions file tests (4 tests)
6. [ ] Fix client message timeout tests (2 tests)
7. [ ] Fix audio buffer handling tests (2 tests)
8. [ ] Fix remaining miscellaneous tests (3 tests)

### Investigation Notes

- **Common Pattern**: Many failures involve connection establishment or idle timeout behavior
- **Last Error Observed**: Timeout waiting for connection status to become 'connected' in `waitForConnection` helper
- **Flaky Tests**: 2 tests marked @flaky in VAD redundancy tests - may need retry logic or timing adjustments
- **Issue #373 Tests**: 2 failures in the feature we're releasing - **CRITICAL** to fix before release

### Next Steps

1. [ ] Review test failure logs in detail
2. [ ] Identify root causes for each failure category
3. [ ] Create fixes following TDD approach (write tests first, then fix)
4. [ ] Re-run E2E tests after fixes
5. [ ] Verify all tests pass before proceeding with release

## Test Summary

### Issue #373 Test Coverage

**Unit/Integration Tests**: 5 tests
- Reference counting for concurrent function calls
- Idle timeout prevention during function calls
- Function call lifecycle management

**E2E Tests**: 4 tests
- Function call execution without timeout
- Concurrent function calls handling
- Function call response delivery
- Connection stability during function calls

### Total Test Coverage

- ✅ **Jest Unit/Integration Tests**: 5 new tests for Issue #373
- ✅ **E2E Tests**: 4 new tests for Issue #373
- **Total**: 9 new tests added for Issue #373

## Implementation Details

### Issue #373: Idle Timeout During Function Calls

**Problem**: The component's idle timeout was incorrectly firing during active function call execution, causing connections to close before function call responses could be sent.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented reference counting for concurrent function calls
- Automatically disable idle timeout when function calls are active
- Re-enable idle timeout when all function calls complete
- Added comprehensive test coverage

**Files Modified**:
- `src/utils/IdleTimeoutService.ts` - Added reference counting logic
- `src/hooks/useIdleTimeoutManager.ts` - Added function call tracking
- `src/components/DeepgramVoiceInteraction/index.tsx` - Integrated function call tracking

**Test Files**:
- `tests/` - Unit/integration tests for idle timeout service
- `test-app/tests/e2e/` - E2E tests for function call scenarios
