## Implementation Details

### Issue #373: Idle Timeout During Function Calls

**Problem**: The component's idle timeout was incorrectly firing during active function call execution, causing connections to close before function call responses could be sent.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented reference counting for concurrent function calls
- Automatically disable idle timeout when function calls are active
- Re-enable idle timeout when all function calls complete
- Added comprehensive test coverage

**Files Modified**:
- `src/utils/IdleTimeoutService.ts` - Added reference counting logic
- `src/hooks/useIdleTimeoutManager.ts` - Added function call tracking
- `src/components/DeepgramVoiceInteraction/index.tsx` - Integrated function call tracking

**Test Files**:
- `tests/` - Unit/integration tests for idle timeout service
- `test-app/tests/e2e/` - E2E tests for function call scenarios
