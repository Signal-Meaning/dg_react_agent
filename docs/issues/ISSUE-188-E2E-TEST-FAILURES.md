# Issue #188: E2E Test Failures - Audio Context and Microphone State Issues

**GitHub Issue**: [#188](https://github.com/Signal-Meaning/dg_react_agent/issues/188)  
**Status**: Open  
**Priority**: High  
**Labels**: bug, high-priority, testing

## üö® Problem Summary

Multiple E2E tests are failing due to audio context initialization and microphone state management issues. The tests are expecting certain audio states that aren't being properly set up or maintained.

## üìä Test Failure Analysis

### **Primary Failure Categories**

#### 1. **Audio Context State Issues**
- **Tests Affected**: `greeting-audio-timing.spec.js` (3 tests)
- **Error**: `Expected: "running", Received: "not-initialized"`
- **Root Cause**: AudioContext not properly initialized before audio playback tests

#### 2. **Microphone State Management**
- **Tests Affected**: `diagnostic-vad.spec.js` (2 tests)
- **Error**: `Expected: "Enabled", Received: "Disabled"`
- **Root Cause**: Microphone state not properly toggled or maintained during tests

#### 3. **Connection State Issues**
- **Tests Affected**: `extended-silence-idle-timeout.spec.js`, `idle-timeout-behavior.spec.js`
- **Root Cause**: WebSocket connections not properly established or maintained

#### 4. **Callback Integration Issues**
- **Tests Affected**: `callback-test.spec.js`
- **Root Cause**: VAD callbacks not properly integrated with component state

## üîç Specific Test Failures

| Test File | Test Name | Error Type | Priority |
|-----------|-----------|------------|----------|
| `greeting-audio-timing.spec.js` | should play greeting audio when user clicks into text input field | AudioContext not initialized | High |
| `greeting-audio-timing.spec.js` | should play greeting audio when user presses microphone button | AudioContext not initialized | High |
| `greeting-audio-timing.spec.js` | should replay greeting audio immediately on reconnection | AudioContext not initialized | High |
| `diagnostic-vad.spec.js` | should provide detailed logging for manual debugging | Microphone state mismatch | Medium |
| `diagnostic-vad.spec.js` | should track WebSocket connection timing | Microphone state mismatch | Medium |
| `extended-silence-idle-timeout.spec.js` | should demonstrate connection closure with >10 seconds of silence | Connection state issues | Medium |
| `idle-timeout-behavior.spec.js` | should handle microphone activation after idle timeout | Connection state issues | Medium |
| `greeting-idle-timeout.spec.js` | should timeout after greeting completes | Connection state issues | Medium |
| `callback-test.spec.js` | should test onTranscriptUpdate callback with existing audio sample | Callback integration | High |

## üéØ Root Causes

### **1. AudioContext Initialization**
- AudioContext is not being properly initialized before audio playback tests
- Tests expect `AudioContext.state` to be "running" but it's "not-initialized"
- This affects all audio-related functionality

### **2. Microphone State Management**
- Microphone state is not being properly toggled during tests
- Tests expect microphone to be "Enabled" but it remains "Disabled"
- This affects VAD (Voice Activity Detection) functionality

### **3. WebSocket Connection State**
- WebSocket connections are not being properly established or maintained
- This affects idle timeout and connection management tests

### **4. Callback Integration**
- VAD callbacks are not properly integrated with component state
- This affects transcription and user interaction tests

## üõ†Ô∏è Proposed Solutions

### **1. Fix AudioContext Initialization**
- Ensure AudioContext is properly initialized before audio tests
- Add proper error handling for audio context creation
- Implement retry logic for audio context initialization

### **2. Fix Microphone State Management**
- Ensure microphone state is properly toggled during tests
- Add proper state synchronization between component and test expectations
- Implement proper microphone permission handling

### **3. Fix WebSocket Connection State**
- Ensure WebSocket connections are properly established before tests
- Add proper connection state management
- Implement proper reconnection logic

### **4. Fix Callback Integration**
- Ensure VAD callbacks are properly integrated with component state
- Add proper callback state management
- Implement proper error handling for callbacks

## üìã Implementation Tasks

- [ ] Fix AudioContext initialization in test setup
- [ ] Fix microphone state management in component
- [ ] Fix WebSocket connection state management
- [ ] Fix VAD callback integration
- [ ] Add proper error handling for audio operations
- [ ] Add proper state synchronization
- [ ] Add proper retry logic for failed operations
- [ ] Update test expectations to match actual behavior

## üß™ Test Environment
- **Browser**: Chromium
- **Test Framework**: Playwright
- **Component**: DeepgramVoiceInteraction
- **Mode**: Dual mode (transcription + agent)
- **API**: Real Deepgram API

## üìà Success Criteria
- All E2E tests pass consistently
- Audio context properly initialized
- Microphone state properly managed
- WebSocket connections properly established
- VAD callbacks properly integrated
- No flaky test behavior

## üîó Related Issues
- [#187](https://github.com/Signal-Meaning/dg_react_agent/issues/187): Singleton Service Refactor (may address some connection issues)
- [#183](https://github.com/Signal-Meaning/dg_react_agent/issues/183): Context Support (may address some callback issues)
- [#184](https://github.com/Signal-Meaning/dg_react_agent/issues/184): Session Management (may address some state management issues)

## üìù Notes
- This issue was created after fixing the Playwright configuration and package optimization
- The test failures are consistent and reproducible
- The issues appear to be related to component state management rather than test configuration
- Priority should be given to AudioContext and microphone state issues as they affect core functionality
