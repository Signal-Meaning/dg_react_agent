# Issue #206 Status Report

**Issue**: [#206 - Prevent WebSocket connections during component initialization](https://github.com/Signal-Meaning/dg_react_agent/issues/206)  
**Status**: üöß IN PROGRESS  
**Branch**: `davidrmcgee/issue206`  
**Created**: January 2025

## Summary

Refactor component to prevent WebSocket manager creation during initialization. Implement lazy manager creation that only occurs when `start()` is called with service flags, or when user explicitly interacts (text input focus or microphone click).

## Implementation Progress

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Remove Manager Creation from Initialization
**Status**: COMPLETE

- ‚úÖ Removed transcription manager creation from initialization (lines 446-603)
- ‚úÖ Removed agent manager creation from initialization (lines 605-704)  
- ‚úÖ Simplified initialization logic - keep only validation, removed mode determination
- ‚úÖ Updated cleanup function to safely handle null managers

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/DeepgramVoiceInteraction/index.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Removed all WebSocket manager instantiation during `useEffect` initialization
- Removed mode determination logging (DUAL MODE, etc.)
- Kept only configuration validation and option storage
- Updated cleanup to handle managers that may never be created

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Create Manager Factory Functions
**Status**: COMPLETE

- ‚úÖ Created `createTranscriptionManager()` factory function with event listeners
- ‚úÖ Created `createAgentManager()` factory function with event listeners
- ‚úÖ Added `configRef` to store configuration for lazy creation

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/DeepgramVoiceInteraction/index.tsx`

**Implementation:**
- Factory functions extract all manager creation logic
- Include complete event listener setup
- Access component state, refs, and callbacks via closure
- Return `WebSocketManager | null` based on configuration

### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Update start() Method
**Status**: COMPLETE

- ‚úÖ Updated `start()` method signature to accept service flags
- ‚úÖ Implemented service flag logic (agent, transcription)
- ‚úÖ Added lazy manager creation in `start()` using factory functions

**Files Modified:**
- `src/types/index.ts` - Updated interface signature
- `src/components/DeepgramVoiceInteraction/index.tsx` - Updated implementation

**New Signature:**
```typescript
start(options?: { agent?: boolean; transcription?: boolean }): Promise<void>
```

**Behavior:**
- If flags provided, respect them to determine which services to start
- If no flags provided, default to starting services based on which props are configured
- Create managers lazily when `start()` is called
- Validate that requested services are actually configured

### ‚úÖ Phase 4: Handle injectUserMessage() Lazy Creation
**Status**: COMPLETE

- ‚úÖ Updated `injectUserMessage()` to create agent manager if needed
- ‚úÖ Made method async to handle connection establishment
- ‚úÖ Ensures connection is ready before sending message

**Files Modified:**
- `src/types/index.ts` - Updated signature to return `Promise<void>`
- `src/components/DeepgramVoiceInteraction/index.tsx` - Updated implementation

**Behavior:**
- Creates agent manager lazily if it doesn't exist
- Establishes connection if not already connected
- Waits for settings to be sent before injecting message

### ‚úÖ Phase 5: Handle startAudioCapture() Lazy Creation
**Status**: COMPLETE

- ‚úÖ Updated `startAudioCapture()` to handle lazy creation
- ‚úÖ Handles case where agent socket is already open
- ‚úÖ Creates both transcription and agent managers when microphone starts

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/DeepgramVoiceInteraction/index.tsx`

**Behavior:**
- Creates transcription manager if needed (for VAD events)
- Creates agent manager if needed
- Checks if agent already connected to avoid duplicate connections
- Connects managers if not already connected

### ‚úÖ Phase 6: Remove autoConnect References
**Status**: COMPLETE

- ‚úÖ Removed `globalAutoConnectAttempted` references from component
- ‚úÖ Removed `AUTO_CONNECT_BEHAVIOR` constant from documentation

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/DeepgramVoiceInteraction/index.tsx`
- `src/constants/documentation.ts`

### ‚è≥ Phase 7: Review CI/Import Context Check
**Status**: REVIEWED

**Decision**: Keep CI/import context check (lines 641-658)

**Rationale:**
- Provides graceful handling in test environments
- Prevents errors when component is imported in non-browser contexts
- Does not interfere with lazy initialization logic
- Useful for package import scenarios

**Location**: `src/components/DeepgramVoiceInteraction/index.tsx:641-658`

### ‚úÖ Phase 8: Update Tests
**Status**: COMPLETE

**Completed Tasks:**
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive lazy initialization test suite (`tests/lazy-initialization.test.js`)
- ‚úÖ Updated existing tests that use `injectUserMessage()` to handle async signature
- ‚úÖ Updated `updateAgentInstructions()` test to start connection first
- ‚úÖ Updated `stop()` test to start connection first
- ‚úÖ Updated `module-exports.test.js` to check for new `start()` signature
- ‚úÖ All 14 new lazy initialization tests passing
- ‚úÖ All existing tests updated and passing

**New Test File**: `tests/lazy-initialization.test.js`
- Tests no managers during initialization
- Tests lazy creation on `start()` with service flags
- Tests `injectUserMessage()` lazy creation
- Tests `startAudioCapture()` lazy creation
- Tests manager reuse behavior

### üìã Phase 9: Update Documentation
**Status**: PENDING

**Tasks:**
- Update README with new `start()` method documentation
- Add examples of service flag usage
- Remove references to autoConnect
- Update API documentation

### ‚úÖ Phase 10: Create Issue Documentation
**Status**: COMPLETE

- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive status document (`docs/issues/ISSUE-206-STATUS.md`)
- ‚úÖ Documented all implementation phases and progress
- ‚úÖ Created E2E test suite (`test-app/tests/e2e/lazy-initialization-e2e.spec.js`)

### ‚úÖ Phase 11: Validate with E2E Tests
**Status**: COMPLETE

**Tasks:**
- Run e2e test suite (`test-app/tests/e2e/lazy-initialization-e2e.spec.js`) with real Deepgram APIs
- Verify no managers are created during component initialization
- Validate lazy creation behavior in real browser environment
- Verify service flags work correctly with real connections

**Status:**
- ‚úÖ Fixed Playwright webServer `cwd` path (changed from `'./test-app'` to `'..'` in `test-app/tests/playwright.config.mjs`)
- ‚úÖ Updated test to verify managers aren't created during component mount (before onReady callback)
- ‚úÖ **Test App Updated**: Removed auto-start from `handleReady` to align with lazy initialization
- üîß **Bug Fix**: `stop()` method now sets manager refs to `null` after closing (was preventing recreation)
- üîß **Bug Fix**: `start()` method logic updated - when options object provided, only starts services explicitly set to `true`
- üîß **Bug Fix**: React StrictMode connection closure - implemented StrictMode detection to preserve connections
- ‚úÖ **All 6 lazy-initialization-e2e.spec.js tests passing** - Lazy initialization behavior validated with real APIs
- ‚úÖ **All 5 strict-mode-behavior.spec.js tests passing** - StrictMode handling validated
- ‚úÖ **simple-mic-test.spec.js tests passing** - Microphone functionality verified with stable connections

**Issues Found:**
1. **`stop()` bug**: `stop()` method was closing managers but not setting refs to `null`, preventing recreation
   - **Fix**: Added `transcriptionManagerRef.current = null` and `agentManagerRef.current = null` after closing
   - **Location**: `src/components/DeepgramVoiceInteraction/index.tsx:1659-1665`

2. **`start()` service selection bug**: When passing options object, `start()` was defaulting to props for unspecified services
   - **Issue**: `start({ agent: true })` was starting both transcription and agent because transcription defaulted to props
   - **Fix**: Updated logic to only start services explicitly set to `true` when options object is provided
   - **Location**: `src/components/DeepgramVoiceInteraction/index.tsx:1539-1548`
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed - `start({ agent: true })` now correctly starts only agent

3. **React StrictMode connection closure issue**: Connections were closing immediately after establishment
   - **Issue**: React StrictMode intentionally double-invokes effects in development, causing cleanup to run and close connections prematurely
   - **Root cause**: useEffect cleanup was closing connections during StrictMode's cleanup/re-mount cycle
   - **Fix**: Implemented StrictMode detection using mount tracking:
     - Added `isMountedRef` and `mountIdRef` to track component mount state
     - Cleanup delays connection closure by 100ms
     - If component re-mounts within that window (StrictMode), connections are preserved
     - Only closes connections on actual unmount
   - **Location**: `src/components/DeepgramVoiceInteraction/index.tsx:161-165, 631-804`
   - **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed - connections now persist through StrictMode cleanup/re-mount cycles
   - **Tests**: Added `test-app/tests/e2e/strict-mode-behavior.spec.js` with 5 tests validating StrictMode behavior

## Testing Status

### Automated Tests
- ‚úÖ Component initializes without creating managers (tested)
- ‚úÖ `start({ agent: true })` creates only agent manager (tested)
- ‚úÖ `start({ transcription: true })` creates only transcription manager (tested)
- ‚úÖ `start({ agent: true, transcription: true })` creates both (tested)
- ‚úÖ `start()` without flags uses props to determine services (tested)
- ‚úÖ `injectUserMessage()` creates agent manager if needed (tested)
- ‚úÖ `startAudioCapture()` creates managers if needed (tested)

- ‚úÖ No autoConnect references remain (verified)

### Test Results
- **New Tests**: 
  - 14 tests in `tests/lazy-initialization.test.js` - all passing
  - 5 tests in `test-app/tests/e2e/strict-mode-behavior.spec.js` - all passing ‚úÖ
- **Updated Tests**: All existing tests updated and passing

### Manual Testing Needed
- [ ] Verify in test-app that component doesn't create connections on mount
- [ ] Verify text input focus triggers agent connection
- [ ] Verify microphone click triggers both connections

## Breaking Changes

### API Changes
1. **`start()` method signature changed**
   - **Before**: `start(): Promise<void>`
   - **After**: `start(options?: { agent?: boolean; transcription?: boolean }): Promise<void>`
   - **Migration**: Add service flags when calling `start()` if you want selective service startup

2. **`injectUserMessage()` is now async**
   - **Before**: `injectUserMessage(message: string): void`
   - **After**: `injectUserMessage(message: string): Promise<void>`
   - **Migration**: Add `await` when calling `injectUserMessage()`

### Behavior Changes
1. **No managers created during initialization**
   - Managers are only created when `start()` is called or user interacts
   - Component will not connect to servers until explicitly started

2. **autoConnect prop removed**
   - No longer exists
   - Component requires explicit `start()` call

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Complete core implementation (Phases 1-7)
2. ‚úÖ Update tests (Phase 8)
3. üìã Update documentation (Phase 9)
4. ‚úÖ Validate with E2E tests (Phase 11) - **COMPLETE**
5. ‚úÖ Final testing and verification - **COMPLETE**
6. ‚è≥ Code review
7. ‚è≥ Merge to main

## Notes

- Factory functions capture all necessary closures (state, refs, callbacks)
- Configuration stored in `configRef` for lazy access
- Managers handle their own event listener cleanup
- CI/import context check preserved for test environment compatibility

## Test Files Modified/Created

### New Test File
- `tests/lazy-initialization.test.js` - Comprehensive test suite for lazy initialization (14 tests)
- `test-app/tests/e2e/lazy-initialization-e2e.spec.js` - E2E tests for lazy initialization with real APIs (6 tests)

### Updated Test Files
- `tests/voice-agent-api-validation.test.tsx` - Updated for async `injectUserMessage()` and lazy creation
- `tests/module-exports.test.js` - Updated to check new `start()` signature
- `tests/start-stop-methods.test.js` - All existing tests still pass (no changes needed due to optional parameter)

## E2E Validation

### E2E Tests Created

Created comprehensive e2e test suite in `test-app/tests/e2e/lazy-initialization-e2e.spec.js` to validate lazy initialization with real Deepgram APIs:

1. **No managers during initialization**: Verifies WebSocket managers are not created when component mounts
2. **start() with agent flag**: Tests that `start({ agent: true })` creates only agent manager and connects
3. **start() with both flags**: Tests that `start({ agent: true, transcription: true })` creates both managers
4. **injectUserMessage() lazy creation**: Verifies agent manager is created lazily when sending text
5. **startAudioCapture() lazy creation**: Verifies managers are created when microphone is activated
6. **Agent reuse**: Tests that microphone activation reuses existing agent connection

### Running E2E Tests

To validate changes with real APIs:

```bash
cd test-app
npm run test:e2e tests/e2e/lazy-initialization-e2e.spec.js
```

**Requirements:**
- Valid Deepgram API key in `test-app/.env` (VITE_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY)
- Test app dev server (automatically started by Playwright webServer config)

### Current Test App Behavior

The test app (`test-app/src/App.tsx`) was updated to align with Issue #206 lazy initialization:
- **Removed auto-start**: `handleReady` no longer automatically calls `start()` (removed in commit)
- **Explicit start required**: The app must explicitly call `start()` when user interacts (e.g., mic button or text input)
- **Test app changes**: Updated to demonstrate lazy initialization pattern - connections only start on user interaction

**Note**: 
- Issue #207 created to investigate dotenv message during Playwright test execution
- Fixed Playwright webServer config: `cwd` changed from `'./test-app'` to `'..'` (relative to config file location)
- Test updated to verify managers aren't created during component mount (before `onReady` callback)
- When running tests: `cd test-app && npm run test:e2e tests/e2e/lazy-initialization-e2e.spec.js`
