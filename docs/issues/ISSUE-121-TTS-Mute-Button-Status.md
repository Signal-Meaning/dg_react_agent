# Issue #121: TTS Mute Button Status Report

**Issue**: TTS Audio Not Playing - Agent Response Generated But No Audio Output  
**Status**: PARTIALLY RESOLVED - TTS audio working, mute button has ref issue  
**Date**: October 21, 2024  
**Priority**: High  

## Summary

Issue #121 was originally about TTS audio not playing at all. This has been **RESOLVED** - TTS audio is now working correctly. However, a secondary issue was discovered with the TTS mute button functionality.

## Root Cause Analysis

### ‚úÖ **RESOLVED: TTS Audio Not Playing**
**Root Cause**: Incorrect TTS mute logic in `sendAgentSettings` function  
**Location**: `src/components/DeepgramVoiceInteraction/index.tsx` lines 1184-1192  
**Issue**: When `state.ttsMuted` was `true`, the spread operator `...({})` didn't actually remove the `speak` property from agent settings  
**Fix**: Inverted the logic to `...(!state.ttsMuted ? { speak: {...} } : {})`  

### ‚ùå **ACTIVE: TTS Mute Button Not Working**
**Root Cause**: Component's `toggleTtsMute` method is not being called via ref  
**Location**: `test-app/src/App.tsx` and component ref exposure  
**Issue**: App.tsx calls `deepgramRef.current.toggleTtsMute()` but the component method is never executed  
**Evidence**: Console logs show App.tsx method calls but no component method logs  

## Current Behavior

### ‚úÖ **Working**
- TTS audio plays correctly when enabled
- Agent responses are generated and displayed
- Audio is audible through speakers
- Mute button UI updates (visual feedback)

### ‚ùå **Not Working**
- Mute button does not stop currently playing audio
- First mute click has no effect
- Second mute click (after unmute) works
- Component's `toggleTtsMute` method is not being called

## Technical Details

### **Log Analysis**
```
[Log] üîá [APP] toggleTtsMute called (App.tsx, line 384)
[Log] üîá [APP] deepgramRef.current is available, calling toggleTtsMute() (App.tsx, line 387)
[Log] üîá [APP] deepgramRef.current methods: ["start", "connectTextOnly", "stop", ...] (App.tsx, line 388)
[Log] ‚úÖ toggleTtsMute() method called (App.tsx, line 390)
```

**Missing**: No logs from component's `toggleTtsMute` method (should show `üîá toggleTtsMute method called`)

### **Ref Issue**
- App.tsx can access `deepgramRef.current` and see available methods
- `toggleTtsMute` is listed in the available methods array
- But calling `deepgramRef.current.toggleTtsMute()` doesn't execute the component method
- Instead, `sendAgentSettings` is called directly (bypassing mute logic)

## Attempted Fixes

### ‚úÖ **Fix 1: TTS Audio Playback**
- Fixed inverted TTS mute logic in `sendAgentSettings`
- TTS audio now plays correctly

### ‚úÖ **Fix 2: Mute Button Logic**
- Enhanced `toggleTtsMute` method with interrupt functionality
- Added proper order of operations (settings first, then interrupt)
- Added comprehensive debug logging

### ‚ùå **Fix 3: Ref Issue (Pending)**
- Added debug logging to App.tsx to track ref calls
- Identified that component method is not being called
- Need to investigate ref exposure or timing issue

## Next Steps

### **Immediate Priority**
1. **Fix ref issue** - Investigate why `deepgramRef.current.toggleTtsMute()` doesn't call component method
2. **Test mute functionality** - Verify mute button stops current audio immediately
3. **Test unmute functionality** - Verify unmute allows future audio

### **Investigation Areas**
1. **Ref timing** - Check if ref is properly set when mute button is clicked
2. **Method exposure** - Verify `toggleTtsMute` is properly exposed in `useImperativeHandle`
3. **Component lifecycle** - Check if component is in correct state when method is called

## Test Cases

### **Passing**
- [x] TTS audio plays when enabled
- [x] Agent responses are generated and displayed
- [x] Mute button UI updates correctly
- [x] Unmute button UI updates correctly

### **Failing**
- [ ] Mute button stops currently playing audio
- [ ] First mute click works immediately
- [ ] Mute state persists across interactions

## Files Modified

### **Core Fixes**
- `src/components/DeepgramVoiceInteraction/index.tsx` - Fixed TTS mute logic, enhanced mute button
- `src/utils/audio/AudioManager.ts` - Added audio buffer flushing for mute

### **Debug Additions**
- `test-app/src/App.tsx` - Added debug logging for ref calls

## Status

**TTS Audio**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
**Mute Button**: ‚ùå ACTIVE ISSUE (ref problem)  
**Overall**: üîÑ PARTIALLY RESOLVED  

The core TTS functionality is working, but the mute button has a ref issue preventing the component method from being called. This is a separate issue from the original TTS audio problem.
