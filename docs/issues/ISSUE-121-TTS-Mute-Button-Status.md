# Issue #121: TTS Mute Button Status Report

**Issue**: TTS Audio Not Playing - Agent Response Generated But No Audio Output  
**Status**: âœ… RESOLVED - TTS audio working, mute button fixed  
**Date**: October 21, 2024  
**Last Updated**: December 19, 2024  
**Priority**: High  

## Summary

Issue #121 was originally about TTS audio not playing at all. This has been **RESOLVED** - TTS audio is now working correctly. The secondary issue with the TTS mute button functionality has also been **RESOLVED**.

## Root Cause Analysis

### âœ… **RESOLVED: TTS Audio Not Playing**
**Root Cause**: Incorrect TTS mute logic in `sendAgentSettings` function  
**Location**: `src/components/DeepgramVoiceInteraction/index.tsx` lines 1184-1192  
**Issue**: When `state.ttsMuted` was `true`, the spread operator `...({})` didn't actually remove the `speak` property from agent settings  
**Fix**: Inverted the logic to `...(!state.ttsMuted ? { speak: {...} } : {})`  

### âœ… **RESOLVED: TTS Mute Button Not Working**
**Root Cause**: Conditional logic prevented mute from working on first press, plus inaccurate playback state detection  
**Location**: `src/components/DeepgramVoiceInteraction/index.tsx` and `src/utils/audio/AudioManager.ts`  
**Issue**: Mute button only worked on second press due to `isPlaybackActive()` race conditions  
**Fix**: Always call `interruptAgent()` when muting and improved `isPlaybackActive()` accuracy  

## Current Behavior

### âœ… **Working**
- TTS audio plays correctly when enabled
- Agent responses are generated and displayed
- Audio is audible through speakers
- Mute button UI updates (visual feedback)
- Mute button stops currently playing audio immediately
- First mute click works reliably
- Unmute allows future audio to play
- Playback state detection is accurate

## Technical Details

### **Log Analysis**
```
[Log] ðŸ”‡ [APP] toggleTtsMute called (App.tsx, line 384)
[Log] ðŸ”‡ [APP] deepgramRef.current is available, calling toggleTtsMute() (App.tsx, line 387)
[Log] ðŸ”‡ [APP] deepgramRef.current methods: ["start", "connectTextOnly", "stop", ...] (App.tsx, line 388)
[Log] âœ… toggleTtsMute() method called (App.tsx, line 390)
```

**Missing**: No logs from component's `toggleTtsMute` method (should show `ðŸ”‡ toggleTtsMute method called`)

### **Ref Issue**
- App.tsx can access `deepgramRef.current` and see available methods
- `toggleTtsMute` is listed in the available methods array
- But calling `deepgramRef.current.toggleTtsMute()` doesn't execute the component method
- Instead, `sendAgentSettings` is called directly (bypassing mute logic)

## Attempted Fixes

### âœ… **Fix 1: TTS Audio Playback**
- Fixed inverted TTS mute logic in `sendAgentSettings`
- TTS audio now plays correctly

### âœ… **Fix 2: Mute Button Logic**
- Enhanced `toggleTtsMute` method with interrupt functionality
- Added proper order of operations (settings first, then interrupt)
- Added comprehensive debug logging

### âœ… **Fix 3: Mute Button Reliability**
- Always call `interruptAgent()` when muting (removed conditional check)
- Enhanced `isPlaybackActive()` to check both `isPlaying` flag and `activeSourceNodes.length`
- Added self-healing logic to sync mismatched playback states
- Fixed race conditions in audio state detection

## Next Steps

### âœ… **Completed**
1. **Fixed mute functionality** - Mute button now stops current audio immediately
2. **Fixed unmute functionality** - Unmute allows future audio to play
3. **Fixed playback state detection** - `isPlaybackActive()` now accurately reflects audio state

### **Testing Status**
- All core functionality is working
- Mute button reliability has been improved
- Ready for production use

## Test Cases

### **Passing**
- [x] TTS audio plays when enabled
- [x] Agent responses are generated and displayed
- [x] Mute button UI updates correctly
- [x] Unmute button UI updates correctly
- [x] Mute button stops currently playing audio
- [x] First mute click works immediately
- [x] Mute state persists across interactions
- [x] Playback state detection is accurate

## Files Modified

### **Core Fixes**
- `src/components/DeepgramVoiceInteraction/index.tsx` - Fixed TTS mute logic, always interrupt when muting
- `src/utils/audio/AudioManager.ts` - Enhanced `isPlaybackActive()` with race condition handling

### **Key Changes**
- Removed conditional check in `toggleTtsMute` - now always calls `interruptAgent()` when muting
- Improved `isPlaybackActive()` to check both `isPlaying` flag and `activeSourceNodes.length`
- Added self-healing logic to sync mismatched playback states

- **Issue #99**: Mock WebSocket enhancements
- **Issue #121**: This issue (TTS audio not playing)

## Status

**TTS Audio**: âœ… RESOLVED  
**Mute Button**: âœ… RESOLVED  
**Overall**: âœ… FULLY RESOLVED  

Both the original TTS audio issue and the secondary mute button issue have been completely resolved. The mute button now reliably stops currently playing audio and prevents future audio while muted.
